## Our Mission

We connect our customers to local restaurants with excess or leftover food and deliver straight to your door. All of our food is tested for quality and freshness. Our goal is to reduce waste across local communities and share savings that can be used to reinvigorate local small businesses. 

## The Food Lifeline

Through personal and industry experience, we discovered that local restaurants were disposing of over 60lbs fresh or unexpired foods at the end of work shifts. This is often due to storage issues, or compliance and strict safety standards. While some of this food should be disposed of, our research indicates that almost half of this disposed food can still be used after these work shifts. Because of this, we developed a plan to partner with local restaurants to pick up this would-be disposed of food, verify the quality and safety, and hand-deliver this food to community members through our partnered delivery drivers. 

Restaurants get to safely dispose of food that would otherwise have been thrown out for a small profit, local community members receive quality ingredients for a lower rate, and we help reduce total food waste across the country!

## How it Works

1. We reach out to local restaurants and partner with them to pick up food at the end of work shifts. 
2. Our partnered delivery drivers agree to meet with our partnered restaurants at a set time after the end of the work shift.
3. The food is delivered to one of our Leftover Lunch locations, where our team sorts through and indexes the food.
4. An app alert is sent out to those in the local area containing inventory and prices of food. This windows closes within 12 hours of the alert being sent out. Use that app to order the food you want and have it delivered to your door that next night!
